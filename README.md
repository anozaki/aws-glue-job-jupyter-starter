# Glue Job Dev Environment

## Setup 1: AWS Glue Development Endpoint

* Easy to setup
* Work just like running a real AWS Glue Job

## Setup 2: Local execution

* Access to AWS resource is a little bit challenging
* Good for testing execution of Glue/Spark
* Runs locally so no cost.

## Which one should I use?

* Usually work with Setup 2 and switch to Setup 1 after Glue/Spark is figured out.

## TODO

* submit spark job from local environment
